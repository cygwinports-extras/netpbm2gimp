sdesc: "Converts Netpbm code to GIMP plugin"
ldesc: "Netpbm2Gimp makes it easy to write plug-ins for the GIMP, a 
popular open-source bitmap-editing program.  Netpbm2Gimp hides all of 
the GIMP and GTK+ features for user-interface manipulation behind 
straightforward functions for reading and writing arrays of pixels. As 
an added benefit, the same source code that Netpbm2Gimp converts to a 
GIMP plug-in can also be compiled into a command-line graphics filter."
